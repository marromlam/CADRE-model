# CADRE-model

The aim of this respository is to store a public version of a MSc subject project. It is all about MDO and optimization,
and every single line of code is MATLAB. In order to run this code MATLAB R2017b or higher is needed, this is because of
some new great functions of MATLAB.

Code is (I think) with plenty of comments, so no need to specify nothing about that here.
